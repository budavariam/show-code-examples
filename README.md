# show-code-examples

Module to view source code in a full screen modal. Suited for html presentations

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run build`
1. Run the example `npm run example`

Step 3 will generate two files in the build folder. A chat-template.js and chat-template-min.js.

See [index.html](https://github.com/sevenleaps/react-webpack-wrapper-example/blob/master/index.html) for an example how these files are consumed.
